## Project Introduction

### Multithreading Optimization for Parallel Processing

This project focuses on optimizing parallel processing for datasets through the implementation of multithreading techniques. Key enhancements include:

- **Multithreading Implementation**: Optimized parallel processing by implementing multithreading, which reduced analysis time by 37%.
- **Stride Scheduling**: Ensured optimal task distribution across multiple processors using stride scheduling.

### Memory Optimization Techniques

Several advanced memory optimization techniques were utilized to enhance performance:

- **Copy-on-Write Fork**: Implemented copy-on-write fork to optimize memory usage.
- **Lazy Zero-Page Allocation**: Utilized lazy zero-page allocation to further improve memory efficiency.
- **LRU Caching**: Enhanced data retrieval performance by using Least Recently Used (LRU) caching.

As a result of these optimizations, memory allocation costs were significantly reduced from thousands of CPU cycles to hundreds of CPU cycles.
